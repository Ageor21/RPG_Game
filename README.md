# Rpg_game
This is a RPG simulation that I coded myself. It doesn't involve any fancy GUI's, but that will probably be a future project. 
* Update as of Octobor 10, 2021
* Fixes enemies actions against user. Now enemies will use the proper moves assign to them 
* Fixed some inconsistencies found in the code (redundancies, errors, etc)
